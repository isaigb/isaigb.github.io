Hi! My name is Isai (think Açaí &rarr; Içaí). I'm currently a student at the UNC School of Education working toward a PhD in Education Policy with a PhD minor in Computer Science. If I'm not working with data you can find me jogging, hiking a mountain trail, kayaking, digging for gold in Deep Rock Galactic or ensuring the factory grows in Factorio.

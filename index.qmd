Hi! My name is Isai (think Açaí &rarr; Içaí). I'm currently a student at the UNC School of Education working toward a PhD in Education Policy with a PhD minor in Computer Science. If I'm not at my desk you can find me jogging, hiking a mountain trail, kayaking, or back at my desk digging for gold in Deep Rock Galactic or Minecraft.

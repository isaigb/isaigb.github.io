I'm interested in the role of higher education for socioeconomic mobility of first generation students and students of color and the application of causal inference and machine learning methods to these questions.

Specifically I'm interested in:

  - Understanding the factors associated with the under-representation of women and students of color in the STEM pipeline.
  - Understanding role of unequal distribution of opportunity on college admission, persistence and completion.
  - Long term outcomes of students after they leave higher education as a function of major choice, college choice, and debt burden.
